## Research Interests
Broadly, I'm interested in problems in 2D geometry that involve probabilistic models and conformal geometry techniques. 

For the past year, I have been working on the geometry properties on dendrite Julia sets. 

I am currently interested in 2D spectral theory in relation to the reflected Brownian motion.

## Papers
* **On Convex Domains maximizing the gradient of the torsion function**, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07340)
* **HÃ¶lder Tree Julia Sets Almost Everywhere on the Circle**, In preparation
* **Julia sets as Conformally Balanced Dendrites**, In preparation
