## Research Interests
Broadly, I'm interested in problems in 2D geometry that involve probabilistic models and conformal geometry techniques. 

For the past year, I have been working on the geometry properties on dendrite Julia sets. 

I am currently interested in 2D spectral theory in relation to the reflected Brownian motion.
