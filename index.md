## About Me:

I am a third-year PhD student in [mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), interested in probability theory, complex analysis, and the rich connections between the two. My advisor is [Stefan Steinerberger](https://faculty.washington.edu/steinerb/).

I currently serve as the Graduate Student Social Coordinator for the UW Mathematics department.

Before coming to the US for my PhD, I was an undergraduate in applied mathematics at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). 

When I'm not doing math, you might find me climbing at rock gyms, hiking on trails or sketching at parks.
